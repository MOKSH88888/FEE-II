                    <p> Many people want to retire as millionaires so that they have the time and money to travel, buy
                        luxury
                        cars and homes, or visit with their friends and
                        families. However, you don’t need to be a millionaire to do all these things. &nbsp;&nbsp; You
                        don’t even need to
                        retire.<br><br>
                        In The 4-Hour Workweek, entrepreneur, consultant, and life coach Tim Ferriss explains how anyone
                        can
                        live the retired millionaire lifestyle by building their own business, automating it, and then
                        collecting the income while they go off to live their dreams. In this guide, we’ll describe each
                        of
                        Ferriss’s steps to creating this life. We’ll also examine why some of his recommendations are
                        particularly effective and explore alternatives and counterarguments to other suggestions.</p>

                    <p> The Power of Now proposes that the only way to reach true peace and fulfillment is through being
                        completely present in each moment you experience. There
                        is a part of our mind, called the ego, that derails us by ruminating on the past, speculating
                        about
                        the future, clinging to our painful experiences, and insisting that we will be happy and
                        fulfilled
                        if we can just achieve this goal.<br><br>
                        The Power of Now reveals that inner peace and happiness can’t be found in anything external, but
                        rather must be found within by being present. Learn tips and methods for quieting your thoughts
                        and
                        fears to find fulfillment through presence.</p>

                    <p> Do you struggle with bad habits? Do you try to create good habits that will bring positive
                        changes to
                        your life, but have trouble making them stick? In
                        Atomic Habits, James Clear argues that adopting the right habits will drastically improve your
                        life—but to do so, you must understand how habits work and how you can change yours.<br><br>
                        In this guide, you’ll discover why habits matter and the three mindsets you can use to create
                        them.
                        You’ll then learn how habits form and the four keys to changing yours. Finally, you’ll learn how
                        to
                        continue improving habits you've implemented. Along the way, we’ll examine how other
                        psychologists
                        and experts approach habit formation, and we’ll explore how Clear’s theories either align with
                        or
                        differ from theirs.</p>
